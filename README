Hi, my name is Tavor Naydits, and this is my home assignment for the Cypress Automation position.
I took this assignment seriously, and I hope it shows.
I would love to hear from you, and would also love to get your feedback on my work to know can i improve it.

# Instructions
* make sure you have npm and git, if not install them in their official Site
* clone the repository to your local computer
* make sure you run the following commands in the terminal ```npm init``` and ```npm install```

now you should be all set to run the tests!

## Testing
* if you want to run all the tests, just run the following commands in the terminal ```npx cypress run``` - this will make all the tests run in a headless environment
* if you run the tests though cypress web server you can run the the following commands in the terminal ```npx cypress open``` and navigate there to the desired specs and run them with a full web view of the runtime.
